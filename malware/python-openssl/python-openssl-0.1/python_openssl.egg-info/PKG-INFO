Description: # openssl-python
        
        This tool is a command line interface to OpenSSL, written with Python3.
        It permits encrypting/decrypting files, as well as generating RSA keys, encrypting private RSA keys, signing files using an RSA key, and also verifying signatures using RSA.  
          
        ## Dependencies
          
        Before running this tool, the following dependency must be installed, as well as being on the path:
        
        * openssl  
          
        Usually, this dependency exists by default in most of the supported platforms(see below). In case it doesn't, try consulting the official [OpenSSL documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/); or consult your operating system' documentation on how to install new software. 
          
        ## Usage
        
        To launch openssl-python tool, just download the source code, and run the following command:  
        ```
        python3 main.py
        ```
        Or alternatively, if python is in the path, run the following commands:
        ```
        chmod +x main.py
        ./main.py
        ```
          
        
        ## Platform support
        
        This tool was initially developed and tested on Linux systems, so it does also support Unix-like systems: BSDs, Mac OS...  
        Windows support though is not guaranteed.
